# Contribution guide

* Insert issue number (e.g. _#16_) to your commit message to link the commit to an issue
* If a commit fixes an issue, use your commit message to close it (e.g. _fixes #16_, _closes #16_)
* Commit __immediatly__ after you work
* Push __immediatly__ after you commit
* Check your TODOs and Issues! When someone addresses you in an issue, commit or comment
* When you want to address someone specific, write _@if15b000_
* When writing something for everyone, write _@all_ at the end of the issue / comment
* Commit messages are in English
* Do __NOT__ push on branches staging or master directly
* Always pull with ``git pull --rebase`` or set it as default using ``git config --global pull.rebase true``
* Do not work on branch develop directly (except minor commits) - use feature branches (click "create branch" on issues)
